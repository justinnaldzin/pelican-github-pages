Welcome!  This is my first post.  Hopefully I keep up with this blog and create some interesting and useful posts.  My goals for this site are to provide:

  * How-to guides
  * GitHub repository documentation
  * Jupyter notebooks
  * Code snippets
  * About me
  * Portfolio

I'd like to share my knowledge and give back to the *data science* community, the same way that they have taught me.  I hope **data engineers** everywhere find these posts relevant and helpful.  Let's go!
