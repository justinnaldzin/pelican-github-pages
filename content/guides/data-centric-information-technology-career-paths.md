## Big Data Engineer

Big data engineers communicate with business users and data scientists to understand the business objectives and translate those objectives into data-processing workflows. Big data engineers should have strong knowledge of statistics, extensive programming experience, ideally in Python or Java, and the ability to design and implement solutions for big data challenges. Knowledge and experience in data mining, processing large amounts of raw data, and designing and maintaining relational databases for storage and data acquisition are desired. Experience with NoSQL is preferred. This individual communicates directly with business users and data scientists to understand objectives and create data-processing workflows. Employers often require a bachelor’s degree in a related field and four to six years of experience.

Typical duties include:

- Gathering and processing raw data and translating analyses
